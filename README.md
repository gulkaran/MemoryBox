# MemoryBox
Using the power of the arduino, I created a product to playback recorded messages corresponding to a sweet message displayed on the LCD screen.

## How It Works
Using an arduino, MP3 module, 5V Speaker, LCD I2C, and a push button module, I crafted the perfect way to send your loved one messages that will never fade away.

## 3D Modeling
Using AUTOCad and Fusion360, I was able to design a 100% unique model to house these components while maintaining the products original theme of love!
